### Observations
#### 1. By looking at the box plot you can assume that the drugs Capomulin and Ramicane are the most effective at reducing total volume of the tumor. The other drugs in the study generally do not reduce the final volume of the tumor as much.

#### 2. Looking at the line plot for Capomulin you can see that around the 20 timepoint that there is a surge in growth then the tumor gradually reduces in total volume. It doesn't look like this drug total kills or stops the growth of the tumor, it looks like it may slow the growth while also help slowly reduce the total volume.

#### 3. When looking at the linear regression model you can see that generally the more the mouse weighs the larger the tumor is. There are some outliers but gernally this is a positive linear correlation.
